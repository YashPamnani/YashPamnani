About Me:
- Exposed to the world of Electronics at the age of 15, which drew me to pursue a degree in the same field. Finding my interest in the field of Robotics, Automation and VLSI, I have worked in this technology. I have created various projects as well as competed in these fields through which I have learned my short comes and work rigorously to improve it.
I am a self-motivated individual, seeking for an opportunity to learn something new and out-perform myself while working with a cross-functional team. Looking for an opportunity where I can apply my passion and use the professional experience to work in multiple domains
