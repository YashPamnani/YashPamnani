👋 Hello, I'm Yash Pamnani

🚀 Senior Design Verification Engineer | ASIC | UVM | Mixed-Signal | SystemVerilog | Python
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate and detail-oriented Senior Design Verification Engineer with over 4 years of hands-on experience in verifying complex ASICs and SoC-level designs. I specialize in building robust, scalable verification environments that ensure first-silicon success and reliable performance for advanced semiconductor products.

🔍 About Me

I'm currently working at Aura Semiconductor, where I’ve contributed to the verification of Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) IPs, timing jitter attenuators, and digital signal processing blocks. My role spans from testbench architecture to coverage closure and post-silicon validation, using state-of-the-art tools and methodologies.

💡 What I Bring to the Table

✅ Core Expertise
- Verification Methodologies: UVM-based verification, directed and constrained-random testing, coverage-driven verification.
- Languages & Scripting: SystemVerilog, Verilog, Python, Perl.
- Protocol Expertise: I2C, AMBA AHB/APB — developed Verification IPs for these protocols.
- Debugging & Analysis: Strong in waveform analysis, assertion-based verification (SVA), and root cause analysis.
- Tools & Environments: Cadence, QuestaSim, Riviera Pro, Xilinx ISE.

🧪 Verification Projects
- PLL and DSP Block Verification: Developed UVM-based verification environment for PLLs and signal processing blocks, validating loop dynamics, synchronization, and fast-locking features.
- Mixed-Signal SoC Verification: Collaborated with analog, digital, and application teams for full-chip validation.
- Checker Development: Implemented checkers and assertions for complex behaviors, including hitless switching and phase-to-frequency correction validation.
- Python Golden Models: Integrated reference models via DPI-C for cycle-accurate comparisons with RTL outputs.
- Post-Silicon Validation: Verified digital features in lab setups, debugging and analyzing performance in real silicon.
