ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Yash Pamnani
ðŸŽ¯ Senior Design Verification Engineer with 4+ years of experience in verifying complex ASIC and system-level designs. Passionate about ensuring high-quality silicon through scalable, modular, and efficient verification methodologies.

ðŸ§  What I Do
- Develop and architect UVM-based verification environments for mixed-signal and digital IPs, particularly Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) and DSP blocks.
- Specialize in protocol verification (I2C, AMBA AHB/APB), coverage closure (code + functional), and SystemVerilog Assertions.
- Create and integrate golden reference models using Python and DPI-C for robust validation.
- Conduct post-silicon validation, cross-functional team coordination, and regression/debug analysis.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Tools
- Languages: SystemVerilog, Verilog, Python, Perl
- Methodologies: UVM, Constrained-Random, Directed Testing, Assertions
- Tools: Cadence, QuestaSim, Riviera-Pro, Xilinx ISE
- Protocols: I2C, AMBA APB & AHB
- Scripting & Automation: Python/Perl for task automation and report generation

ðŸ“Œ Projects Highlight
- Owned verification of multiple PLL sub-blocks and DSP filters, ensuring functional correctness and performance validation.
- Designed checkers for loop dynamics and synchronization in jitter attenuating clock synthesizers.
- Architected router protocol verification from scratch during training at Maven Silicon.
